   <p>
     I started running way back when I was 11 years old because Doc said I had
     to shave a couple pounds lol. At first it was just to live a healthier
     lifestyle, but then I joined my middle school cross country team where I
     met some of my bestest friends. I fell in love with the feeling of pounding
     on the pavement mile after mile. A couple thousand miles later and I'm here
     running in college. Contrary to popular belief, running cross country is
     much more than going outside and running for hours. Enjoy the workout
     schedule our coach gave us for next week!
