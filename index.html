    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
  I am a third year Information Technology Student at Illinois Tech. I was born
and raised in the western suburbs of Illinois, but i like to say i'm from
Chicago haha. I run varsity cross country and make clothes on my free time. When
i'm not in class or running on the local trails, you can find me hitting up
local food joints around the city!
